## 👤 About Me

I'm Reena, a Computer Science and Bioinformatics student at the **University of Toronto** focused on building computational tools that make complex biological questions tangible. My work spans molecular data pipelines, interactive visualization, and interdisciplinary research that bridges lab science with software engineering.

### 💻 What I've Worked On
- Analyzed prairie biodiversity and extinction dynamics using R and Python across 200+ field transects, surfacing stability and dominance signals for restoration planning.
- Modernized the Bio-Analytic Resource (BAR) with Flask + SQLAlchemy services that expose 5+ TB of curated gene expression data to dozens of research groups.
- Delivered interactive R Shiny and Python dashboards that turn ecological and genomic datasets into accessible decision-support tools.
- Built predictive software systems, from ML-driven epidemiology engines to adaptive NLP typing assistants that reduce keystrokes for accessibility-focused users.

### ⚙️ What Drives Me
- Curiosity about how algorithms, statistics, and biological systems intertwine.
- A commitment to rigorous, reproducible research—clean code, tested pipelines, and transparent visuals.
- Interdisciplinary collaboration, whether debugging a data pipeline, shaping UI/UX flows, or learning new wet-lab techniques like PCR, DNA extraction, and gel electrophoresis.

### 🔭 Looking Ahead
I'm energized by roles that blend biology, computation, and design—bioinformatics, health tech, ecological modeling, or any space where better tools unlock better scientific questions.
